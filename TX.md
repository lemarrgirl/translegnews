## Texas

### House Bill 2693 and Senate Bill 1311, 

"State Rep. Steve Toth and State Sen. Bob Hall quietly filed House Bill 2693 and Senate Bill 1311, respectively, which would make it illegal for any physician in Texas to provide gender-affirming care to transgender people under the age of 18., including prescribing puberty blockers and hormones or performing gender-affirming surgery." ([Chron](https://www.chron.com/politics/article/arkansas-anti-trans-bill-texas-16064413.php))

"Under the bills, health care providers who offer gender-affirming care would lose their license to practice in the state." ([Chron](https://www.chron.com/politics/article/arkansas-anti-trans-bill-texas-16064413.php))
